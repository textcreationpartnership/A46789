            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Waited with some impatience to see that Design accomplished by your Acurate Pen, which is here attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted now by my weak Hand. Ever since you were pleas'd to Acquaint me with your Intention to Publish something of this Nature, It rais'd my Expectation of your Obliging the World with your Printed Prayers, as you have done with many of your Learned and Seasonable Sermons. But after you had let me know the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Holding your Hand, The same might have stopt mine too, and I should have desisted, Had those Worthy Authors that have thus bestowed their pains, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended to such Particulars, as I thought
<pb facs="tcp:32255:3"/> fit for the use of those whom I desire to Serve.</p>
            <p>But now that I am Engag'd, My Lord, your Favour shew'd to the Well-meant Performance here, has given me the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this Dedication. And the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of such Persons to high Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in our Church, as are known so well to Deserve it, Encourages me also to Hope, That the Gracious God hath yet a greater Blessing for us, than our own Demerits give us reason to Expect.</p>
            <p>I beg your Fatherly Benediction upon me and my poor Endeavours, who am,</p>
            <closer>

            <head>The PREFACE, To my Neighbours and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Particularly those in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes</hi> committed to my Care.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Dear Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is especially for your Sakes, and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily for your Service, That I Publish this <hi>Manual</hi> of Prayers; fitted to the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of your Minds, to the Necessities of your Souls, and to the several Conditions and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of your Lives. There is, I acknowledge, a Multitude of such Books of <hi>Devotion</hi> already Extant; Many of which are very Useful and Excellent in their kinds; and such as I should Recommend to you, without offering any other; Did those with which I am best satisfied, reach as <hi>far</hi> as I have designed here to go: And did not I think the Strain of some might be too High for many of you: And the Words and Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of others that I have seen in your hands, too Low and Flat, or too <hi>Obsolete</hi> and Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and which will rather Offend, than Edify, such as have their Senses better <hi>Exercis'd</hi> in these matters: For which and the like Reasons I was induced to add my <hi>Contribution</hi> to the common Stock. Yet not taking upon me so to Correct or Censure them that have gone before
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:32255:4"/> me, as to Discourage any from making use of those Helps, which they find Agreeable to their Case, and Efficacious to Quicken their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But leaving every one to consult their own Sense, Profit and Comfort, in Chusing and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king what best likes their particular <hi>Gust,</hi> and what most furthers their pious <hi>Designs;</hi> And to make what Alterations also they please, even in the ensuing <hi>Offices,</hi> for their own Service, if they shall think fit to use them at all.</p>
            <p>Nor have I such a Conceit of any thing that is my <hi>Own,</hi> as to suppose it Free from the Weakness and Defects, which I can espy else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: I doubt not but others may find as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Faults here. Nay, I cannot think any thing of this Nature to be so <hi>Compleat,</hi> but that the Author himself, (in tract of Time) may see reason to Add or Substract, to Alter or Amend many Particulars. Indeed I shall as soon expect to see a <hi>Shoo</hi> made to fit every <hi>Foot,</hi> as a particular Form of Prayer exactly to suit the circumstances of every Soul.</p>
            <p>I cannot undertake that the following Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers should answer all the Occasions which any one may ever find for Prayer: But they that have the <hi>Spirit of Supplications</hi> can tell how to fill up what is Wanting: And such as I Help in most cases, may Help themselves in the rest. I am rather apt to think, that so many as are here set down will be censur'd for more than Needful: But (it being easy to Pare off) the
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:32255:4"/>
               <hi>Censors</hi> may let alone what they count <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous;</hi> Leaving it to those that will not Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain this Assistance. And I had rather be under an Imputation from some of my Neighbours, for Busying my self more than I had <hi>Need,</hi> in a work that might have been Spar'd; Than bear the <hi>Recoilings</hi> of my own Mind, for Neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Impart any thing, that I thought might be of Use and Service to the rest.</p>
            <p>If any Judge, That I might better have left this <hi>Behind</hi> me, till I should my self have been no more <hi>Seen:</hi> I was once of the same Mind, and had so Continued; But that I could not be Sure, that many for whom I design'd it, might not be <hi>Taken off</hi> before me: Whereby this piece of <hi>Friendship</hi> which I had for them would have been lost to them. I confess that I do Undertake thing which is liable to Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, (whoever be the Manager); Every one thinking he has a Title to Judge of that, wherein every one is <hi>Equally</hi> concern'd: And that Judgment passing according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Principles and Sentiments, and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Genius</hi> and Humour of each, 'Tis not possible here to Please every one: But however I shall not Fail of my Design, If I can but be so Happy, as to profit some. And if so be I take any Way Peculiar to my self, I shall only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, That it is but the same Liberty as most <hi>Writers</hi> of this Subject have taken. I Pretend not to set my self on a Level with the Noted
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:32255:5"/> Guides of others Devotion, that with good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess and general Approbation have laboured herein; but yet when our Lord has only Enjoyn'd the <hi>Thing</hi> to be done, without Setling the <hi>Manner</hi> of performance, Even an Ordinary Man that is but Conversant in these Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, has Room humbly to <hi>Propose</hi> his own Experience, As long as he Assumes not Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterially to <hi>Impose</hi> it upon his Readers; Which, in this present Undertaking, the <hi>Judge</hi> of all Thoughts knows it to be far from mine.</p>
            <p>I name no Morning and Evening Prayers for <hi>Particular</hi> Persons: Because here are so many Occasional Prayers, whereof every one may take their Choice, from time to time, for <hi>Private</hi> Use, according to particular <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.</hi> And besides those for <hi>Families</hi> may as fitly serve for the Closet, changing but the <hi>Plural</hi> number into the <hi>Singular.</hi> I make no Distinction neither of Ordinary days: For I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not why the Prayer that serves for <hi>Monday</hi> or <hi>Tuesday,</hi> should not be as good and proper for any other day of the Week. Yet I have offer'd some Variety; That you may take sometimes one <hi>Form,</hi> and sometimes another, as you see Occasion, or shall judge most Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>
            <p>But I make a great Difference of the <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of Persons, <hi>States</hi> of the Soul, and <hi>Scenes</hi> of the Life; According to which, I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed and suited the <hi>Offices</hi> here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:32255:5"/> And though it be not needful (were it possible) to Adapt a Prayer to every Man's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Imployment</hi> in the World; Yet no Man, (whatever be his Place and Calling) but may find many Prayers here fitted to the condition of his Soul, and the great Emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of his Life. Only I would Caution any who may need to be so <hi>Advertis'd,</hi> That I do not intend the particular Prayers here Entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for such and such Persons of particular Ranks and Stations, As their <hi>Excuse</hi> to <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persede</hi> all Praying else; As if such Persons needed to use no <hi>other</hi> Prayers: But those, over and above, they may sometimes <hi>Add</hi> to the rest: And so prudently Chusing <hi>Agreeable</hi> Offices; And taking this my whole Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with a little of Christian <hi>Candor,</hi> and the Allowance for common Weakness; I am willing to hope, it may not be unacceptable to those in my Neighbourhood, (for whom I am chiefly concerned) As coming from one of your own Acquaintance, (My Brethren) and One not so utterly Unacquainted with the Practice and the Benefit of such Exercises of Devotion, but that I am able to say somewhat from my own <hi>Experience</hi> (and that of many Years) in this way. However small, (I must Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess) is my <hi>Proficency,</hi> to what it might have been; Yet the several <hi>Stages</hi> that my Soul has gone through, The Tryals and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that I have had, The Terrors and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:32255:6"/> wherewith I have grapled, The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts and Troubles of Mind that I have lain under, The many Sins that I have fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, (Grievous to my self, and Heinous in the Sight of God, Though not so <hi>Scandalous</hi> as some others, to the View of the World:) And the <hi>Escapes</hi> that I have made, The Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and Deliverances, The Mercies and Blessings, The <hi>Revivings</hi> and Comforts that I have found, are so many <hi>Incitements</hi> to me, and so many <hi>Engagements</hi> upon me, to do somewhat, according to the Ability which God hath given me, for the Direction, the Support, and Help of others, that may be in the <hi>like</hi> Condition. And may the Thing here done, be but well taken by any that fear <hi>God,</hi> The Generation of them that <hi>Seek his Face,</hi> and are in Love with Prayer; I shall then little concern my self, What's the <hi>Resentment</hi> or Censure of any one else, Whether it be the Worldly <hi>Drudge,</hi> the Sordid <hi>Earth-worm,</hi> that throws Prayer out of Doors, as his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption</hi> and Hindrance; or the Dissolute <hi>Epicure,</hi> that takes pleasure in nothing but his Mire, and shrinks from drawing Nigh to the <hi>Holy God</hi> as his hated <hi>Task</hi> and <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> Or the Profane <hi>Droll,</hi> that Laughs his <hi>Judge Eternal</hi> in the Face, and mightily Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds himself, for daring to make a <hi>Scorn</hi> of all that is <hi>Serious</hi> and <hi>Sacred;</hi> Or the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling <hi>Impertinent,</hi> that is for all manner of
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:32255:6"/>
               <hi>Exercises,</hi> but only those of <hi>Religion;</hi> Or lastly, the Formal <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> that only now and then passes a slight <hi>Complement</hi> on the <hi>Majesty</hi> of Heaven, but still mortally Hates the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of Godliness: The <hi>Sense</hi> and the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> of one Pious <hi>Experienced</hi> Christian that has known the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Truth,</hi> is more to me, than the <hi>Exceptions</hi> and the <hi>Clamours</hi> of a Thousand such as these.</p>
            <p>If this Work fly further Abroad, than my first Intention; And if others that know nothing of what concerns me, may pick out any thing here, to further 'em in the way Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; I shall have the more cause then to Bless God, for making me such an <hi>Instrument</hi> of his Grace. Yea, where I can but do the least <hi>Good</hi> to any poor Soul, I shall not think my Labour in <hi>Vain</hi> in the Lord. But my great Care is for the Souls of whom I have the Charge, and for the rest of my <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi> within my reach, Whom I have, (you know) so much and often <hi>Importun'd</hi> and call'd upon, To Give your selves to Prayer, both in your <hi>Families,</hi> and in your <hi>Retirements</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day.

               <hi>for Private Devotion,</hi> thus Freely and Moderately gives his Sense:</p>
            <p>P. 62. <q>Whether every particular Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or the just Words be <hi>Forethought,</hi> it haply matters not very much: But that some fit, significant, proper, and Quickening Expressions for the several Parts and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials</hi> of my Prayer, be <hi>Prepared,</hi> it is Expedient.<hi>—P.</hi> 81. I profess my self no whit guilty of Undervaluing the <hi>Free Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> of the Soul before God, (in Private especially) in such Expressions as the Affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moved Mind suggests; or as the <hi>Spirit</hi> gives Utterance.<hi>—P.</hi> 284. If I am able to Pray otherwise, I shall not haply always see it fit or convenient to use Set or Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:32255:7"/> Forms: For that there may be many particular affecting Circumstances in my Sins, which no Form will express so plainly, as I have need to Express them, for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of my Sorrow.<hi>—P.</hi> 285. If I find my heart ready, and so Composed, That I dare venture upon what we call a <hi>Conceived</hi> Prayer, it being of my own Invention, by the Assistance of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> may more perfectly suit my condition in all, than one Framed by another to my hand.<hi>—P.</hi> 81, 82. Though constantly to use that Way, may make our Devotions more <hi>slight</hi> and <hi>disorderly,</hi> through the Coldness, Dulness, or Heedless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our Hearts; Or through Distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Incumbrances, or like Mischiefs. And it may often occasion the <hi>Omission</hi> of many Necessary things, through Incogitancy, and unavoidable Forgetfulness.<hi>—P.</hi> 8. But whether the words in which we utter our selves, be <hi>Forethought</hi> or <hi>Sudden,</hi> provided they fitly and reverently express the inward Sense of our Hearts, it matters not, nor is at all <hi>Essential</hi> to Prayer.<hi>—P.</hi> 81. Be the Words whose they will, my <hi>Praying</hi> them, <hi>(i. e.</hi> Offering them up to God) with a Heart suitable to them, hath made them as much <hi>Mine,</hi> as if I had Invented, Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Dictated, or Penn'd them at first.</q>

            <p>The Manner then of Expressing your selves, in my Words, or in your own, or others, I leave
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:32255:8"/> (as here this <hi>Author</hi> does) at <hi>Liberty:</hi> And any Helps that I have offered, in the following <hi>Specimens,</hi> you may Take or Refuse, as you see Good. Only I must with all Earnestness, Beseech you to take Care, and to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, That the Duty be daily done, and that Heartily, as to the Lord: As ever you hope to reap any real Good from the Labours of your Ministers, or ever to see their Faces, or the Face of God with comfort, in that Great Day, when we must all give up our Last Accounts, and be finally Determined for our Everlasting State. When such as could not be prevailed with to <hi>Give</hi> themselves to Prayer, and to call upon the Name of <hi>God,</hi> now in the Day of <hi>Grace,</hi> this Time of Mercy, shall with <hi>Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> Desires, Wish themselves out of Being; And no less Vainly, than Desperately, call upon Rocks and Mountains, to <hi>Fall</hi> upon them, and to Hide them from his Face, and Save them from his <hi>Wrath,</hi> in the Day of <hi>Judgment,</hi> that Time of Recompence and <hi>Fury.</hi> And therefore according to that most Cogent Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Author of the <hi>Whole Duty of Man, Part</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. <q>Let no man that professes himself a Christian, keep so <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish</hi> a Family, as not to see that God be Daily Worshipped in it.]</q> To which let that be added of the other <hi>Author</hi> afore-quoted. <q>

            </p>
            <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:32255:8"/>
            <p> Beloved, I am more sensible of my own Frailty, than to reckon upon a much Longer <hi>Continuance</hi> in the World, (Which we all shall find to be so short a <hi>Thoroughfare</hi> to the Place of our Eternal Abode) And while I Live, I desire nothing more from you, than the Consolation of Observing your <hi>Devotion,</hi> and Striving together with me in your Prayers, for your own Salvation. And when I am Dead and gone, I would leave Behind me, not only some <hi>Token</hi> of my Love to you, but also some <hi>Assistance</hi> in that way of your Duty, wherein ye are to Follow those who are already enter'd into the Heavenly Glory.</p>
            <p>I am apt to think, That some who are Convinc'd of this Duty, (To use <hi>Dayly</hi> Prayers) and who also feel an Inclination to it, and some Disposedness for it, in their Hearts, may yet be under a Discouragement, for want of suitable Helps in a Readiness, to Discharge the work. For such, Alas, is the Dulness and Indifferency of Sinful men to that which is▪ Best for them, and which most highly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them, That they are not apt to be <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous,</hi> (so as they use to shew themselves in their Worldly Concernments) to Seek out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Provisions and Conveniences for the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Life; Unless these fall directly in their Way, and are set just before them. And therefore this Prayer-Book, I have had in my Thoughts to Provide, and to put it into the
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:32255:9"/> Hands of some of the Poorer sort; And (without Imposing upon any) I would also Move such able Friends, as may Favour the Design, to lend a Charitable hand, in Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Furnish more of those Poor Creatures, who by the help of such a Gift, might be put in a way to get the best and greatest Riches. But I shall not offer to disturb any that are in the Possession of better Means already. No, Let them go on with the Use of 'em, and God's Blessing be upon 'em. And if but any thing here shall be found <hi>Agreeable</hi> and Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to others, They are at Liberty to <hi>Collect</hi> and take what they will, and pass over the rest. For (as the Celebrated Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> tells us) <hi>[Pract. Cat.</hi> Lib. 3. Sect. 2. Answ. 5.] <q>The Church being obeyed in the observation of the prescribed <hi>Liturgy</hi> in Publick, It is not supposed by our Church, But that every one, in Private, may ask his own Wants, in what <hi>Form</hi> of words he shall think fit. Yet that he may do it Fitly and Reverently, It will not be amiss for him, to Acquaint himself with the several Addresses to God, which the Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> and other <hi>Helps of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi> will afford him; Either to use, as he finds them fit for the present Purpose, Or by those <hi>Patterns,</hi> to Direct and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himself to do the like.</q>

            <p> Now may this poor Attempt of mine be an Invitation to some of my Pious and Learned Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the <hi>Ministry,</hi> to set out some better Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment for their <hi>People:</hi> And I shall be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly Satisfied and Pleas'd, to see the thing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, and still further Improv'd; Though my whole Performance should be <hi>Vacate</hi> and Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to make room for others deserving the <hi>Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> In the mean Time, May a <hi>Blessing</hi> from Above follow these small Endeavours of Mine, and make them <hi>Prosperous</hi> (in any measure) to Help Your Devotion.

What manner of Love is this, That we, (of Rebels against Heaven, Slaves of Satan, and Children of Wrath) should be made the Children of the <hi>most High,</hi> and <hi>Heirs</hi> of everlasting Glory! We are Thine, O Lord, for thou hast Made us out of Nothing; and lookt upon us in our Blood, to revive again, after we had Destroyed our selves. Thou <hi>art in Heaven:</hi> O that we may in Heart and Mind thither Ascend; and with all Lowliness, worship at the Footstool of thy Glorious Majesty.

That all the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of the World may become the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of our Lord, and of his Christ, and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> be made the Joy and Praise of the whole Earth! O that Christ may Dwell and <hi>Rule</hi> in our Hearts by his Spirit and Grace; and make us a Willing People, the faithful Subjects of his holy <hi>Kingdom;</hi> And still Reign over us here, till we are made fit to Live and Reign with him, and all his Redeemed, in the Heavenly Glory.

               <p>O Lord God, Merciful and Gracious, Long-Suffering, and abundant in Goodness and Truth!

How excellent is thy <hi>Loving-Kindness,</hi> O God! therefore do the Sons of Men put their <hi>Trust</hi> under the Shadow of thy Wings.

               <p>And teach us, O Lord our God to Use this World, without Abusing it; And to Enjoy the things here, without Losing our Part in thy <hi>Love,</hi> which is better than Life. Whatever we have of the World, O may we have

               <p>O Lord God that <hi>Hearest Prayers,</hi> and art <hi>Nigh</hi> to all that call upon thee in Truth; having thy Ears open to a World of Creatures, that continually depend upon thee. As we are moved by our own <hi>Necessities,</hi> so are we encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the daily <hi>Experience</hi> of thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, still to shelter our selves under the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32255:23"/> Shadow of thy Wings, and to continue our Suits and Supplications at the Throne of Grace. And we beg of thee, who Fashionest all the Hearts of the Sons of Men, That thou wilt <hi>Prepare</hi> our Hearts to come into thy holy Presence, and to Call upon thy Blessed Name, in a due and Acceptable manner. O! Pour upon us the Spirit of <hi>Grace</hi> and of <hi>Supplications:</hi> And let thy good Spirit Help our <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi> and Teach us to Pray; and to ask such Things, and in such a Way as shall be most agreeable to thy Will, and most advantageous to our Souls.</p>
               <p>We have taken upon us to Speak unto thee, the Sovereign Majesty of Heaven and Earth, who are but poor Worms, and sinful Dust and Ashes, That have too just cause to be Afraid, lest our great and manifold Sins had <hi>Provoked</hi> thee to Hide thy Face from us, and to shut up thy Loving-kindness in Displeasure. For we have done Foolishly and Wickedly, in not Hearkening to the Calls of thy <hi>Word;</hi> nor yielding to the Motions of thy <hi>Spirit,</hi> to walk in the Ways which thou hast set before us. Our Iniquities are increased over our Heads, our Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass is grown even up to Heaven, and our Sins are a sore <hi>Burden,</hi> too Greivous and Heavy for us to bear. They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:32255:24"/> Debts, and sad Accounts, for which if thou, O Lord, shouldst enter into Judgment with us, we could not Answer thee One of a Thousand: But must lay our hands upon our Mouths, and plead nothing but <hi>Guilty;</hi> having our whole dependance upon thy <hi>Mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O God be Merciful to us miserable Sinners; For his Sake, whom thou hast Exalted to be a <hi>Prince</hi> and a <hi>Saviour,</hi> to give Repentance to thy People, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of their Sins; Be Merciful to us, we pray thee, and <hi>Heal</hi> our Souls, that have greatly sinned against thee. O Heal our <hi>Backslidings:</hi> Renew us to <hi>Repentance:</hi> Establish our <hi>Hearts</hi> in thy true Fear and Love: And Establish our <hi>Goings</hi> in thy holy Ways: That we may not be so Wavering, and bent to Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding; Nor Revolt from thee, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Folly,</hi> after thou in Mercy hast spoken <hi>Peace</hi> to our Souls: But may go on Conquering and to Conquer, all the Enemies of our Souls, and all the Hindrances of our Salvation, till <hi>Satan</hi> be Bruised under our feet.</p>
               <p>O thou God of all Grace! Bring such Thoughts to our <hi>Minds,</hi> and lay such Considerations home powerfully upon our <hi>Hearts,</hi> as thou knowest most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to Prevail with us; to Work us to

Make us <hi>Humble</hi> in an High Estate, <hi>Contented</hi> in a Low, and still duly <hi>Careful</hi> of our Souls in all: Following after the things now, which will bring us the true Peace and Comfort at the last.</p>
               <p>Dispose of us, we beseech thee our God, and of all that concerns us this day, to the <hi>Glory</hi> of thy Name. O keep us at all Times, and in all Places and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, from the Evil of <hi>Sin,</hi> and from all other <hi>Evils,</hi> to which the Greatness of our Sins does make us liable. And take thou, O Heavenly Father! the gracious Charge and Guidance and Government of us; And so Lead us here in all our ways, with thy <hi>Counsel,</hi> that hereafter thou may'st Receive us into thy <hi>Glory;</hi> Through thy tender Mercies, and our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s abundant Merits; In whose own Words, we beg all things Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for our selves and others at thy Hands, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>O Lord our God!

Thy Hands, O Lord, have Made us, and Fashioned us; And thou hast Breathed into our Nostrils the breath of <hi>Life:</hi> Yea, still thou holdest our <hi>Souls</hi> in Life, and givest us every Good thing that makes our Lives a <hi>Blessing</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> to us.

               </p>
               <p>But, O Lord our Lord! we have not brought thee the Glory, which thou hast made us <hi>Capable</hi> of, and so many ways <hi>Obliged</hi> us to. Instead of that, O how greatly have we <hi>Dishonoured</hi> thee our god, in the whole course and Conduct of our Lives! Time after time, <hi>Forgetting</hi> the Gracious Giver of all our Good things, who art never <hi>Unmindful</hi> of us; And O how soon have we been Weary to do thee <hi>Service,</hi> who art never Weary to do

               <p>And for these things we desire to pour out our Hearts, and to Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our Sinful selves here before thee: Intreating thy gracious Favour, for the sake of that Mercy of thine in Christ Jesus that has moved thee to Spare us so long, and to do fo much for us already; That thou wilt be pleas'd to give us <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>Pardon,</hi> for all that is past, wherein we have Offended thee; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Omitting of our Duty, or Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, or doing contrary to it, How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we have transgressed; O Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us duly under the <hi>Sense</hi> of it, and Absolve us throughly from the <hi>Guilt</hi> of it.</p>

               <p>O Lord, we desire to Seek thy <hi>Face,</hi> and to Wait upon thee, in the duties of thy <hi>Worship;</hi> Intreating thy gracious Favour with our whole hearts, That we may do all as we ought, with good <hi>Acceptance</hi> to our God. And to whom should we make our Applications, but unto thee, the Father of <hi>Mercies,</hi> and the Fountain of all <hi>Goodness;</hi> who art <hi>Able</hi> to do exceeding abundantly for us, even above all that we Ask or Think: And who hast declared thy <hi>Willingness</hi> to be Importun'd and Sollicited by us; and thy <hi>Readiness</hi> to Hear, and Help, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer us, in those things which we beg at thy gracious and bountiful Hands, in the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Mediation</hi> of our great Lord and Saviour! O let our Prayer be set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee as <hi>Incense,</hi> and the Lifting up of our hands be as the <hi>Evening-Sacrifice,</hi> pleasing to thee our God, in the Son of thy Love! 'Tis in his blessed Name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, that we have Encouragement and <hi>Boldness</hi> to beg of thy Infinite Goodness, all that thou knowest to be Needful and Expedient for us, seeing there is in our selves no Good thing to <hi>Recommend</hi> us to thy Favour and Acceptance; But a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:32255:42"/> Proneness and Inclination to what is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing in thy <hi>Eyes,</hi> and destructive to our <hi>Souls.</hi> For besides, that we were by Nature the <hi>Children of Wrath,</hi> A <hi>Seed</hi> of Evil-doers, The Sinful <hi>Off-spring</hi> of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Parents, We have been daily Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing upon thee, and still Adding to the heavy Score of our Offences against thee. There is nothing in us, O Lord, but what may provoke thee to <hi>Reject</hi> us: But there is enough in thy Beloved Son, of all Grace and Goodness, to move thee mercifully to <hi>Accept</hi> us. He was made <hi>Sin</hi> for us, that knew no Sin, that we might be made the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of God in him: And that we might be saved through Faith in his <hi>Merits,</hi> where we could not be saved by any Desert of our own <hi>Works.</hi> Behold him who was <hi>Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> for our Transgressions, and <hi>Bruised</hi> for our Iniquities: And as the <hi>Chastisement</hi> of our Peace was upon Him, So let the <hi>Merit</hi> of his Righteousness be upon us; and <hi>by his Stripes let our Souls be Healed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor do we only beg for <hi>Pardon</hi> of our Sins, but also for <hi>Power</hi> against them; and <hi>Grace</hi> sufficient for us, to Break them off, and to walk more pleasingly before thee, in all the ways and duties of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Holiness, which they Word prescribes to us. O never suffer us to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:32255:43"/> be Tempted above what we are <hi>Able;</hi> But make our Temptations <hi>less,</hi> or thy Grace in us, and our Spiritual Strength, <hi>greater</hi> than all our Temptations: That no Iniquities may <hi>Prevail</hi> against us, nor any Presumptuous Sin have <hi>Dominion</hi> over us. O make us more Conformable to the <hi>Pattern</hi> and the <hi>Precepts</hi> of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; And more <hi>Transformed</hi> into his holy Image and Likeness: That we may not profess the <hi>Religion</hi> of Jesus, to the Wrong and <hi>Disparagement</hi> of it; Nor make the way of <hi>Truth,</hi> by reason of us, to be <hi>Evil-spoken</hi> of: But let our Light shine before men, to the <hi>Glory</hi> of thee our Heavenly Father, and to the <hi>Edisication</hi> of those with whom we have our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.</p>

               <p>O Lord our God, most High and Mighty, most Wise and Holy, and Just and Good! Thou art, and ever wast, and for ever shalt continue, unspeakably Blessed and Glorious, above all that we are able to <hi>Express</hi> or to <hi>Conceive.</hi> Thou dost not need the Services of <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Angels,</hi> to make the least addition to thy <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Bliss.</hi> Man cannot be <hi>Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> unto God; Our Goodness will not extend to the Lord. But in Kindness and Love to our <hi>Souls</hi> it is, that thou art pleas'd to lay thy Commands upon us, To wait upon thee in these duties of thy

                  <hi>immediate Service,</hi> which is the blissfull Imployment of all the glorious <hi>Host</hi> of Heaven. Thou Humblest thy self even to behold the things that are in <hi>Heaven,</hi> to take notice of the Worship of those <hi>Blessed</hi> Creatures above: O how wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is thy Condescension then, to look down upon us, poor sinful <hi>Worms,</hi> that dwell here in houses of <hi>Clay,</hi> whose foundation is in the <hi>Dust!</hi> Lord, what is <hi>Man,</hi> that thou takest knowledge of him, and the <hi>Son</hi> of man, that thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest Account of him! Thou canst not <hi>Need</hi> us, nor any thing of ours, O Blessed God; But we all stand in great and continual need of thee, our <hi>Sovereign Good;</hi> Of thy Mercy and Forgiveness, thy Grace and Guidance, thy Blessing and Assistance: Without which we could never hope to escape the Curses and Miseries which are the due <hi>Wages</hi> of our Sins, nor ever to attain unto that Glory and Blessedness which is the <hi>Free-Gift</hi> of God in Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>The Desire of our Souls, therefore, is to thy <hi>Name,</hi> O Lord, and to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> of thee: Our eyes are towards thee, and all our Expectation is from thee: And still we wait, and call, and Depend upon thee, till thou have mercy upon us, according to our several <hi>Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities;</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:32255:45"/> and according to the riches of thy <hi>Grace,</hi> and the multitude of thy <hi>Mercies.</hi> O Remember not against us <hi>Former</hi> ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; Enter not into Judgment with us, according to the <hi>desert</hi> of our Sins: But according to thy <hi>Mercy</hi> Remember thou us, for thy Goodness sake, O Lord.

               <p>But notwithstanding all thy Patience and Gracious dealings with us, and all the repeated Pledges of thy Favour and Kindness to us; O how ill have we <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited</hi> thy Love! And what unsuitable <hi>Returns</hi> have we made for all thy great and continued Goodness that we have found! Beside the Guilt of Sin and our
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:32255:48"/>
                  <hi>Inbred</hi> Corruption, which as a sore Clog, hangs heavy upon us; We are amaz'd at the Greatness and Multitude of all our other Sins that we have committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Light and Teachings of thy <hi>Gospel,</hi> the Dictates and Strivings of thy <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the Love and Sufferings of thy <hi>Son:</hi> Against all the Patience and Long-suffering which thou hast exercised towards us; And against the many Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and <hi>Methods</hi> of our Conversion and Sanctification, wherewith, from time to time, thou hast sought to make us what we should be. O Lord, we have given thee so great Provocation, that we are afraid lest thou shouldst <hi>Forsake us</hi> utterly, and cause the day of thy <hi>Patience</hi> to be at an end with us, and grant us no more of the <hi>Grace</hi> which we have so greatly <hi>Abused;</hi> No more of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which we have so frequently <hi>Resisted.</hi> And what have we now but Judgment to expect from thee, O Lord, but that thy <hi>Mercy</hi> rejoyces over <hi>Judgment!</hi> And thy Word assures us, That thou delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not in the <hi>Death</hi> of Sinners, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they should turn to thee and <hi>Live.</hi> Therefore still thou leavest us these Opportunities to appear before thee, to <hi>Plead</hi> with our God, for the <hi>Life</hi> of our Souls that have Sinned against thee. And
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:32255:49"/> what have we to Plead, O Blessed Lord, but thy own Gracious <hi>Nature,</hi> and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful <hi>inclinations,</hi> and the many <hi>Promises</hi> and <hi>Declarations</hi> of thy self, which thou hast made to Returning-Sinners in Jesus Christ? Thou hast sent thine only Son to be our Almighty Saviour: And he that did no Sin, was <hi>Manifested,</hi> to take away our Sins. O for his Sake be thou pleased to <hi>Pity</hi> us, and <hi>Spare us,</hi> and <hi>Forgive</hi> us! Turn away thy Wrath from us, Receive us to thy blessed <hi>Favour,</hi> and comfort us with the sure Persuasion that our great and many Sins are <hi>Remitted</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And because such is the Infirmity of our Nature, that without thy Grace we have not the <hi>least Power</hi> to keep our selves, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the <hi>greatest Sins;</hi> O grant us the <hi>Increase</hi> of thy Grace, and such <hi>Help</hi> of thy good Spirit, as may Fortify us against all <hi>Temptations,</hi> and make us Willing and Faithful, and Diligent in thy <hi>Service.</hi> And be pleased, O Lord, yet further to Discover and Manifest thy self to our Souls, That we may know aright, Thee, the <hi>Only True God,</hi> and <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> whom thou hast sent. And give us Power from on High, to enable us so to Live and Practice, according to that <hi>Light</hi> and Knowledge of our Duty, which thou art pleased to impart unto us, That we may

               <p>Which things we beg not only for our selves, but for all the <hi>Partakers</hi> of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whom thou hast made to share in our Hopes and <hi>Capacities</hi> of Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness: Especially for thy whole <hi>Church,</hi> wheresoever or howsoever disposed of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Earth: For the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Majesty;</hi> and all our <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Governers:</hi> For our <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Teachers:</hi> For our <hi>Relations</hi> and <hi>Neighbours;</hi> our <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors:</hi> And for all thy <hi>Afflicted,</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be their Tryals and Troubles.

               <p>Thou art the great <hi>Preserver</hi> of men, who hast Kept and Blest us <hi>To day,</hi> and all our Days. Praised be thy Name for all thy Goodness, which we so Long and

               <p>O Lord our God! Thou art infinitely Good, and thou hast shewed us what is Good, and what thou requirest of us for our own greatest Good always, that it may go well with us both now, and to all Eternity.

Thou hast not been Wanting to us, O Lord, But we have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly Wanting to <hi>Our selves,</hi> and to the Duty which we owe unto our God.

Because thou hast Called, and we have Refused, Thou hast stretched forth thy Hands, and we have not Regarded; Thou mightest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leave us to our own <hi>Perverseness</hi> and <hi>Impenitence,</hi> to add Sin unto Sin, till our Iniquities became our Ruin.</p>
               <p>But O Lord God, Merciful and Long-suffering! we humbly beseech thee, that thou wilt not so enter into Judgment with thy Servants.

               <p>Command a Blessing, we pray thee, O Lord, upon the <hi>Word</hi> which this day we have heard, and upon all the Means of <hi>Grace</hi> that have been us'd for the good of our Souls.

               <p>O Lord God, Glorious in <hi>Holiness,</hi> and of Purer Eyes, than to behold any <hi>Iniquity,</hi> without Abhorrence of it, and Indignation against it! How shall Man, Sinful Man, that drinks in Iniquity like <hi>Water,</hi> appear before thee! And how shall we, Vile and Frail, Polluted and Depraved as we are, shew ourselves in the <hi>Presence</hi> of such a Great and Wise, Just and Holy God, as thou art! When we look upon thy Perfect Law, and see what we should be, What manner of Persons, in all holy Conversation, and Godliness; And when we Reflect on our own <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Lives,</hi> and find what we are; How <hi>Wanting</hi> in our duty, and how <hi>Contrary</hi> to that holy Rule, which thou dost Prescribe us, to Keep our Hearts, and to order our Conversation by; We cannot come into thy Presence, O Lord, without <hi>Confusion</hi> of Face, and <hi>Anguish</hi> of Soul, and <hi>Remorse</hi> of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to think how Foolishly and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly we have done; and how Abject and Wretched we have made ourselves; even Viler than the Dust of the Earth, or any thing that Moves upon it.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:32255:74"/>
               <p> Besides that, we brought with us a <hi>Corrupt Nature</hi> into the World, full of Strangeness to thee our God, and full of Enmity against thy Holy, Good, and Righteous Laws; We have <hi>Mis-spent</hi> the most of our Time here in the Neglect of thy <hi>Work,</hi> and in Disobedience against thy <hi>Word,</hi> Daily multiplying our <hi>Offences</hi> against thee, as thou hast been pleased daily to multiply thy <hi>Blessings</hi> and <hi>Favours</hi> upon us. O the Precious <hi>Time</hi> that we have Lost, The <hi>Means</hi> that we have Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, The <hi>Mercies</hi> that we have Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, The <hi>Calls</hi> and <hi>Warnings, Offers</hi> and <hi>Invitations,</hi> that we have Disregarded! How Bold have we made with thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Majesty,</hi> and with thy holy <hi>Laws!</hi> What little awful <hi>Regard</hi> have we had of thee! What little Conscientious <hi>Fear</hi> of Offending thee!</p>
               <p>O the Crying Sins and Abominations, The Prevailing Wickedness, and the Bold, Open Impieties, <hi>[The Swearing and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, The Pride and Uncleanness, The cruel Enmity and all manner of Injustice, The corrupt Communication, and ungodly Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation]</hi> whereby God is so greatly Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and Provoked every day, almost every where! And O how large a Share have we had in Adding to the <hi>Publick</hi> Guilt! Sinning as we have done, in all

And not only through Weakness and Surprize, and the Violence of <hi>Temptations,</hi> But many times Knowingly, Wilfully and Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously; With a High Hand, and Stiff Neck, against thee our Glorious <hi>Maker,</hi> and <hi>Judge</hi> Eternal! And O how great a Weight have we added to all our other Sins, by the <hi>Hardness</hi> of our Hearts, and our <hi>Impenitent</hi> Continuance in our Sins! Committing <hi>Great Sins</hi> with <hi>little Remorse,</hi> little Penitent Concernment for all the Evils whereof we have been Guilty! Yea, Lord, how unsuitable still are our Hearts and our Lives to those holy Rules, which thy Word gives us in charge to follow! So much is there still <hi>Amiss</hi> with us, and <hi>Wanting</hi> in us, that it is the great abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy of our Lord, thou dost yet <hi>Lengthen</hi> out our Lives, and thy Patience with us, and still leave us any of these Opportunities, to Humble ourselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, and to cry for Mercy to thee, in that day of Grace, which through the <hi>Forbearance</hi> of our God is yet over us.</p>
               <p>We have not <hi>Glorified</hi> thee, O Lord, in bearing Fruits of Holiness answerable to thy Revealed Will, and to thy Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Love: But we desire to give <hi>Glory</hi>

               <p>Thou canst shew us Great and Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty things, which we know not, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all our <hi>Expectations,</hi> as well as our <hi>Deservings,</hi> by thy bountiful Favours.

And how often, in our Distresses, sent wonderful <hi>Redemption</hi> to us! And to thee who hast Helpt and Deliver'd, we look still for Help and Deliverance. O our God! be thou pleased to take the <hi>Motive</hi> now from thy own <hi>Mercy,</hi> that has so far been pleas'd to Interess thy <hi>Glory</hi> in our <hi>Safety:</hi> And go on to Help and Deliver us, for the <hi>Glory</hi> of that Mercy which first made us thy <hi>People.</hi> Turn us again,

And though thou shouldst feed us with Bread of <hi>Adversity,</hi> and Water of <hi>Affliction,</hi> Yet let not our <hi>Teachers</hi> be removed into <hi>Corners.</hi> O bring us not under a <hi>Famine</hi> of the Word of the Lord: Nor give us over to the Formality of a <hi>Lifeless</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, under all the Means of Grace, to send <hi>Leanness</hi> into our Souls.

It is thou that givest Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto <hi>Kings,</hi> that deliverest thy Servants from the hurtful <hi>Sword.</hi> Thou hast Saved us from our <hi>Enemies,</hi> and put them to <hi>Shame</hi> that Hated us. It was not by our own Power or <hi>Conduct,</hi> that we have been so Prosperous; Nor did our own Sword or Arm Save us: But thy right Hand, and thy Arm, and the Light of thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, because thou hadst a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> unto us. Thine, O Lord, is the Greatness, and the Power, and the Glory, and the <hi>Victory.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> is our Strength, and our Song, and is become our Salvation. Now therefore, our God, we Thank thee, and Praise thy Glorious Name. And O what cause hast thou given us to Rejoyce in thy <hi>Goodness,</hi> that thou hast not given our Enemies
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:32255:91"/> cause to Rejoyce in our <hi>Ruin!</hi> Great is thy Mercy, O Blessed Lord, and to thee alone be the whole Praise and Glory. O make us more Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of this thy <hi>Help</hi> at hand, in time of our <hi>Need:</hi> And give us Grace still to keep the <hi>Memory</hi> of it in our Grateful Minds. O thou Great Lord of Hosts, who givest such Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and good Success, Wilt thou teach us also rightly to <hi>Use</hi> thy Sweet and Marvellous Kindness and Love: That being delivered from the hands of our <hi>Enemies,</hi> we may serve thee in <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> before thee, all the days of our Lives; and not fly out into Licentious car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as if we were Deliver'd to commit <hi>Abominations;</hi> (so throwing ourselves into the hands of our <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Foes, after we have <hi>Escaped</hi> the other:) But demeaning ourselves as the Redeemed and Oblig'd of the Lord, O let us Love and Trust, and Bless and Praise the <hi>Reliever</hi> of our Misery, the only <hi>Giver</hi> of all Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and the God of all our <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> for ever and ever.</p>

               <p>I was in woful Perplexity: Fear was on every side: All my Hope was ready to <hi>Expire;</hi> and I thought there was no Help for me, but I must Sink and Perish.

O Blessed be God, who has not cast away my Prayer, nor his Mercy from me. But Dearest Lord! Thou hast kept me in <hi>Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and caused the Destruction so to pass over me, that I suffer'd but in my own <hi>Fears</hi> of what I have so little <hi>Felt.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without Amazement look back upon the <hi>Perillous</hi> case that I was in, and the <hi>Brink</hi> of Ruin that I lay upon. And that I should <hi>Escape,</hi> as I have done, O how <hi>Marvellous</hi> is it in my Eyes! And O what cause have I for thy Praise, that I am here <hi>Alive</hi> to Praise thee!

               <p>O Most High God, infinitely Glorious above all our Expressions or our Thoughts! Thou sittest on the <hi>Circle</hi> of the Earth, and the Inhabitants thereof are as <hi>Grashoppers;</hi> Yea, before thee, all Nations are as <hi>Nothing,</hi> and counted to thee, <hi>Less</hi> than Nothing, and Vanity. O what is <hi>Man,</hi> that thou shouldest be so <hi>Mindful</hi> of him! Yea that he should be so <hi>Unmindful</hi> of his own Vileness and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, To <hi>Exalt</hi> and Lift up himself, and to Swell with the <hi>Conceit</hi> of his own Worth and Excellence! I desire, O Lord, to <hi>Humble</hi> my self, That I have been no more <hi>Humble;</hi> But have thought more <hi>Highly</hi> of my self, than I ought to think; And <hi>Vaingloriously</hi> set off my self before Men, When I deserve only to be <hi>Despised,</hi> and Nothing but <hi>Confusion</hi> is my Portion. O thou that Resistest the <hi>Proud,</hi> and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest Grace to the <hi>Humble,</hi> Give me the Grace of <hi>Humility;</hi> And make me Mean and Vile in my <hi>own Eyes,</hi> that I may be Accepted in <hi>thy Sight.</hi> Make me, Lord, of the number of those <hi>Poor in Spirit,</hi> those <hi>Humble</hi> and <hi>Contrite Ones,</hi> to whom thou wilt Look, and with whom thou wilt Dwell.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:32255:108"/>
               <p> O set my Sins in order before me, and make me to know my Transgressions; That I may not <hi>Flatter</hi> my self in my own Eyes, but carry it as becomes poor Sinful <hi>Dust and Ashes;</hi> who deserve to be <hi>Trodden</hi> under foot, and to be cast out, as the <hi>Off-scowring</hi> of all things: Taking nothing but <hi>Shame</hi> to my self, and giving all the <hi>Glory</hi> to thee, of whatever is <hi>Good</hi> in me. Great and Holy God! Make me more Studious to be thy <hi>Favourite,</hi> than to be so <hi>Accounted;</hi> And better pleas'd to do my <hi>Duty,</hi> than to <hi>Hear</hi> of it. Neither of <hi>Men</hi> let me Seek Glory, but the Honour that comes of <hi>God</hi> only. And the more I have <hi>Received</hi> from thee, the more let me <hi>Ascribe</hi> unto thee; And not be Proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Opinioned of my self; But give all Thanks and Glory to <hi>Thee,</hi> for any Good, wherein thou hast made me to <hi>Differ:</hi> Not Loving or Intending the <hi>Praise</hi> of men, in doing the <hi>Work</hi> of God; But performing all my Offices, as one that is <hi>Indeed,</hi> and not only Called, <hi>Thy Humble Servant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O Discover me so to my self, that I may still walk <hi>Humbly</hi> with my God, and be <hi>Cloathed</hi> with Humility: Considering how Frail I am as a <hi>Creature;</hi> and how Vile, as a <hi>Sinner.</hi> Let me ever Detest and

               <p>O Lord God Almighty, and ever Blessed! In whom we all ever Live, and Move, and Are. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it to be of thy Mercies, we are not <hi>Consumed,</hi> because thy Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions fail not. If thou hadst, long before this time, cut us off in our <hi>Sins,</hi> and shut us up under final <hi>Despair</hi> of thy Mercy; Yet Righteous hadst thou been; O Lord; And how justly might'st thou now refuse to Hear us, Calling upon thee in our <hi>Prayers;</hi> As we so often have Refus'd to hear thee, Calling upon us by the motions of thy <hi>Holy Spirit!</hi> But thou art <hi>God,</hi> and not <hi>Man;</hi> And <hi>thy</hi> Thoughts are not as <hi>our</hi> Thoughts, Nor <hi>thy</hi> Ways as <hi>our</hi> Ways: But as the <hi>Heavens</hi> are higher than the Earth, So are thy Thoughts and thy Ways <hi>Above</hi> ours. Thou art our Refuge and Strength, and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:32255:131"/> present Help, in time of Need and <hi>Trouble:</hi> In which times thou hast commanded us to <hi>Call</hi> upon thee; And hast pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to <hi>Hear</hi> us, and to give us cause to Praise and <hi>Glorifie</hi> thee for thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Mercy to us.</p>
               <p>And now we come to thee, O Lord our God, in behalf of this thy <hi>Servant,</hi> that lyes here in a Low and <hi>Distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> State under thy <hi>Chastizing</hi> hand: Look down we beseech thee, Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upon him: And be thou Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Favourable to him; according to the <hi>Necessity</hi> of his Case, And according to the multitude of thy tender <hi>Mercies</hi> in Jesus Christ. In as great Danger as he is, Yet if thou wilt, O Lord, thou canst set him up, and make him <hi>Whole:</hi> If thou but speak the <hi>Word,</hi> the thing will be done. And in Submission to thy most Wise and Good Disposal of all things, we would beg this <hi>Mercy</hi> at thy Hands; That thou would'st be pleas'd to Rebuke his <hi>Distemper,</hi> to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thy <hi>Stroke,</hi> and cause the bitter <hi>Cup</hi> which thou hast given him, to <hi>pass</hi> away: And make him a way to <hi>Escape</hi> out of the Affliction that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. And to this end, That thou would'st Direct to the <hi>Means</hi> proper for his Help; And command a <hi>Blessing▪</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:32255:132"/> them, to promote his <hi>Recovery.</hi> Spare him, Good Lord, and <hi>Restore</hi> him, if it be thy Will: That he may have a <hi>Longer</hi> time to work out his Salvation, And be more <hi>Useful</hi> in his Place, and do more <hi>Good</hi> in his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Or however thou shalt be pleas'd to deal with him, as to the concerns of his <hi>Body;</hi> (which we pray may be in a way of <hi>Gentleness</hi> and tender Mercy) Yet Lord, let his Soul be ever Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in thy Sight. And may this <hi>Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of his Body, be for the <hi>Health</hi> of that Immortal Better part.</p>
               <p>O give him a right Discerning of the things belonging to his <hi>Peace,</hi> before they be hid from his eyes. <hi>Shew</hi> him what he has to do; And <hi>Enable</hi> him for the doing of it: That he may have the Sound Peace with God through <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Give him the true <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> towards God, and the right <hi>Faith</hi> in the only Saviour of the World. Wash and cleanse his Soul with the <hi>Blood</hi> of thy Son, and the <hi>Graces</hi> of thy Spirit; That it may be deliver'd from all <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements</hi> it has contracted in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent evil World; and be found Safe and Happy in the hour of <hi>Death,</hi> and in the great <hi>Day</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ. Fit him, O Lord, for <hi>Living</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:32255:132"/> or <hi>Dying,</hi> Or whatever in thy Wise and Righteous Providence, thou hast designed for him: That it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him <hi>Christ</hi> to Live, and <hi>Gain</hi> to Die: That in all he may find cause to <hi>Glorify</hi> thy Name; Still experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing thy Gracious <hi>Goodness</hi> to him, in the Son of thy Love. If thou shalt please yet to <hi>Release</hi> him from his bed of Languishing, to live longer upon Earth, O that he may Live to <hi>Thee,</hi> In thy <hi>Fear,</hi> and to thy <hi>Praise;</hi> And do thee <hi>better</hi> Service, and bring thee <hi>greater</hi> Glory. Or if thou hast determined, That this Sickness shall be a Sickness unto <hi>Death,</hi> and this Visitation his <hi>Last</hi> Visitation, Prepare him, O Merciful God, by thy <hi>Grace,</hi> for thy Blessed <hi>Self:</hi> And grant him a Safe and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable <hi>Passage,</hi> out of this Wretched <hi>Life,</hi> to an infinitely <hi>Better.</hi> Through the Merits and Mediation of thy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, our only Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>

Thou Givest, and Takest away; Raisest and Dashest our Hopes; Sendest and Destroyest our Comforts: And thou art <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> in all. 'Tis <hi>Just</hi> we should be deprived of the <hi>Enjoyments,</hi> which we nothing but Slight and Abuse: Yea, 'tis <hi>Good</hi> for us to have those things taken from us, which our Abuse makes <hi>Hurtful</hi> to us. Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be thy Name then, even when thou <hi>takest</hi> away, as well as when thou <hi>Givest.</hi> Yet O Lord, who art justly Displeased for our Sins, In Mercy turn these <hi>Losses</hi> to the Advantage of my <hi>Soul:</hi> And so <hi>Repair</hi> the Breaches, out of thy own Infinite Fulness, That I may find thy own Blessed Self unto me more and <hi>Better</hi> than many, even such <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Comforts.</hi> They were but the <hi>Instruments</hi> and Means of Conveyance; Thou the Eternal <hi>Spring</hi> and Fountain of all Good, art still the Same: And amidst all these Changes, never <hi>Changest</hi>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:32255:139"/> at all: And what thou didst derive to me by such <hi>Means,</hi> thou canst more than make out to me <hi>another</hi> Way.</p>
               <p>O my Heavenly Father, take my Eyes and Heart and Hope off such poor <hi>Dying</hi> Comforts, to fix them upon the only <hi>Satisfying</hi> Good; in the enjoyment of which, consists all my true Life and Peace and Bliss. And let the great <hi>Emptiness</hi> and frequent <hi>Disappointments</hi> that I find in all the Comforts of <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and all the Enjoyments of the <hi>World,</hi> teach me more Wisdom, than to place my <hi>Affections</hi> and <hi>Dependance</hi> upon them; And help to <hi>Disengage</hi> and Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen my Heart from them; And raise up my <hi>Desires</hi> and <hi>Hopes</hi> to the Glorious Permanent <hi>Objects,</hi> so infinitely to be Preferred before them. O let me be more <hi>Crucified</hi> to the World, where is nothing but Emptiness and Frustration, <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexation</hi> of Spirit: And may I have my Conversation more in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Where is my Blessed <hi>Lord,</hi> and all his Happy <hi>Followers,</hi> of whom the World was not <hi>Worthy;</hi> And every thing that the Soul of Man can <hi>Want</hi> or <hi>Wish.</hi> O God of the <hi>Spirits</hi> of all Flesh, Especially of the Just made <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> Help me so to Follow thy Servants my Friends <hi>Departed</hi> in the Lord, That
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:32255:140"/> I with them, may attain at last, to live in the Sight and Presence, in the Love and Praises, and in the Fellowship and Enjoyment of thee my <hi>God,</hi> Blessed for ever.</p>

               <p>O Lord my God, I hope thou hast, of thy rich Mercy, Changed and Renew'd me in some measure; And wrought a <hi>Good Work</hi> upon me, to bring me out of my Natural and <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi> condition, into the State of Grace and <hi>Salvation.</hi> But yet the Carnal Nature is so <hi>Predominant</hi> over me, and many Sins so <hi>Lively</hi> and <hi>Strong</hi> in me, And still I find the Good things of thy Spirit in so much Weakness and <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> upon me; That the Sorrows of my Heart are enlarged, and my Soul is <hi>Disquieted</hi> within me: Seeing too frequent cause to Question, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my <hi>Spots</hi> are the Spots of thy <hi>Children;</hi> Whether I have known the Grace of God in <hi>Truth,</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I do not <hi>Deceive</hi> my self, in Reckoning upon that, which I neither <hi>Am,</hi> nor <hi>Have.</hi>

               <p> Mine Eyes are to thee, O God the Lord, Leave not my Soul <hi>Destitute.</hi> From the Ends of the Earth will I cry to thee; When my heart is <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed</hi> within me, Lead me to the <hi>Rock</hi> that is Higher than I. O Lord Rebuke me not in thy <hi>Anger,</hi> Neither Chasten me in thy Sore <hi>Displeasure.</hi> Forsake me not, O my God, Be not far from me. Make haste to Help me, O Lord my Salvation. Attend to my <hi>Cry,</hi> for I am brought very <hi>Low:</hi> Hear me speedily, My Spirit <hi>fails.</hi> Save me, O God, for the Waters are come in to my <hi>Soul:</hi> I sink in the deep <hi>Mire,</hi> where there is no Standing. Bring my Soul out of <hi>Prison,</hi> that I may Praise thy Name.</p>
               <p>O shew me the true <hi>Estate</hi> of my Soul: And make me to know the things that are Freely given me of God. And Deliver me, Gracious Lord, from all those things that Provoke thee to Hide thy Face from me, And that wrap up my Soul in <hi>Clouds</hi> and <hi>Darkness,</hi> and make me so much a Stranger to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> O grant that I may have a clear dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the <hi>Evidences</hi> of my Calling and Election; And Seal a comfortable <hi>Assurance</hi> of thy Blessed Love in <hi>Christ</hi>

And let the Joy of the Lord be my <hi>Strength,</hi> to make me <hi>Victorious</hi> over my Sins, and always to <hi>Abound</hi> in thy Work; Never pleas'd so much with any thing, as to do the things pleasing to my <hi>God,</hi> through Jesus Christ.</p>

               <p>O Lord the great and <hi>Dreadful</hi> God, against whom I have greatly Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and who for my Sins art justly Displeased. When I consider the <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of thy Laws, and the <hi>Strictness</hi> of thy Justice; And when I reflect upon the <hi>Heinous</hi> and <hi>Innumerable</hi> Sins of my Heart and Life, My Flesh <hi>Trembles</hi> for Fear of thee, and I am Afraid of thy <hi>Judgments.</hi> O who may stand in thy Sight, when once thou art <hi>Angry?</hi> Who can bear up for ever, under all the <hi>Vials</hi> of thy Wrath, to the uttermost pour'd out!

               <p>HOly God! I desire to Humble my self here before thee for that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual <hi>Proneness</hi> which is in me, to Sin against thee; That I am so <hi>Unlike</hi> to Thee; and so <hi>Contrary</hi> to what thy Holy Laws require me to be. After all the great things thou hast done for me, Alas, How apt am I still to <hi>Spoil</hi> and <hi>Undo</hi> my self! The malicious <hi>Tempter</hi> is laying Snares for me every where: And the things of this <hi>World</hi> are still pressing hard upon me; Either to <hi>Terrify</hi> me out of my Duty, Or to <hi>Humour</hi> me into my Ruin. And O how ready is my sinful <hi>Flesh,</hi> to Side with the Cruel Enemy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my own <hi>Soul!</hi> Innumerable <hi>Evils</hi> have compass'd me about; My <hi>Iniquities</hi> have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to <hi>Look up.</hi> They are more than the <hi>Hairs</hi> of my Head, therefore my Heart fails me. O the Sin that still <hi>dwelleth</hi> in me, that is so nigh to me, that does so easily <hi>Beset</hi> me, and is so apt to <hi>Prevail</hi> against me; To pull me away from the <hi>Obedience</hi> of thy Blessed Will; And to engage me in <hi>Forbidden</hi> things, Displeasing in thy Sight, and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:32255:151"/> Destructive to my Soul! O <hi>Wretched</hi> man that I am! Who shall <hi>Deliver</hi> me from the Body of this <hi>Death!</hi> When the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> of Sinning has so Increased my Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Inclinations,</hi> That the <hi>Leopard</hi> may as soon Change his <hi>Spots,</hi> and the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> his <hi>Skin,</hi> as I who am <hi>Accustomed</hi> to Evil, can of my self <hi>Cease</hi> from it: If the Lord of <hi>Hosts</hi> be not with me; If the God of <hi>Jacob</hi> be not my Refuge.</p>
               <p>But with thee, the Almighty God, all things are <hi>Possible:</hi> Yea, thou canst as easie <hi>make</hi> us Holy, as <hi>Bid</hi> us be so. To thee the very Powers of <hi>Hell</hi> are Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Nothing in the World can <hi>Resist</hi> thy Will. O Pity thy poor <hi>Tempted</hi> Creature, and give me not up, in Justice, to a <hi>Reprobate</hi> Sense, and to <hi>Vile</hi> Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Nor to such <hi>Blindness</hi> of Mind, and <hi>Hardness</hi> of Heart, as should render me past <hi>Feeling:</hi> Nor ever Punish my <hi>Former</hi> Sins, by giving me over to their <hi>Sway</hi> and Power. But let it be thy gracious Pleasure, O Lord, that all my <hi>Prevailing</hi> Iniquities may flee and <hi>Perish</hi> at thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.

O how small is my <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> to that which is Good! How much am I behind many of thy <hi>Servants,</hi> who have not had the Helps and Advantages which I so long have enjoyed! And how little is it to be seen in my <hi>Life,</hi> what great things the Lord has done for my <hi>Soul!</hi> O my God! I have not Improved the <hi>Talents,</hi> which thou hast put into my hands; Nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Kindness</hi> of Heaven, which I have so long Experienc'd. Thou hast not been <hi>Wanting</hi> to me, O Good Lord! But I have been exceedingly Wanting to my <hi>Self,</hi> and to that <hi>Duty</hi> which I owe to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:32255:157"/> my God. I am Ashamed that it is no <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> with me: That so many Mercies have been <hi>Spilt</hi> and <hi>Lost</hi> upon me. Forgive me, O my Father! and Repair thy holy <hi>Image</hi> in me; Who have so much Dishonoured thee, and Disabled and Spoil'd my self. O help me still more and more, to Put off the <hi>Old</hi> man, which is corrupt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the deceitful Lusts; And to put on the <hi>New,</hi> which, after God, is Created in Righteousness and true Holiness. What ever else I want, Lord deny me not thy <hi>Grace;</hi> But <hi>Increase</hi> it in me, And Discover it still <hi>more and more</hi> upon me. Yea, let the Graces of thy Spirit, that accompany Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, so <hi>Flourish</hi> in my Soul, That the Peace of God which passeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing may keep my Heart and mind through Christ Jesus.</p>
               <p>Blessed Saviour! who camest into the World, that we might have <hi>Life,</hi> and have it more <hi>Abundantly!</hi> Of thy Fulness let me receive Grace <hi>Sufficient</hi> for me; to make me <hi>Strong</hi> in the Lord, and <hi>Ready</hi> to every Good work. My Life, My Strength, and My Redeemer! Leave me not under the Curse of <hi>Barrenness,</hi> To stand at a <hi>Stay,</hi> or to <hi>Decline</hi> in my Spiritual estate: But as thou hast wrought all my Works in me, <hi>Stablish,</hi> O God, that which thou hast wrought for me: And <hi>Strengthen</hi> the things
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:32255:158"/> which remain, that are ready to <hi>Die:</hi> And <hi>Cherish</hi> all the Seeds of Grace sown in my Heart; That my Soul may <hi>Prosper</hi> and Increase with the Increase of <hi>God;</hi> As a watered <hi>Garden,</hi> and a <hi>Spring</hi> whose Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Fail not: <hi>Growing</hi> in Knowledge and Grace, and <hi>Abounding</hi> in all those Fruits of Righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the Glory and Praise of God. That so I may be fully satisfied of the <hi>Truth</hi> of thy Grace in me, by its <hi>Growing</hi> upon me. O my Lord! Carry on with <hi>Power</hi> the work of Faith and Sanctification in my Soul; That my sinful <hi>Corruption,</hi> every day like the House of <hi>Saul,</hi> may grow <hi>Weaker</hi> and <hi>Weaker;</hi> And thy <hi>Grace</hi> in me, every day, like the House of <hi>David,</hi> may grow <hi>Stronger</hi> and <hi>Stronger;</hi> Till from <hi>Groaning</hi> under Sin, the Body of this Death, I come to <hi>Triumph</hi> over all that opposes and hinders the Progress of my Spiritual Life. And as thou art pleas'd to afford me the <hi>Means</hi> of Grace, O grant me the <hi>Increase</hi> of thy Grace, to answer the <hi>End</hi> of all those Means: That in the use of them, I may be made still <hi>Wiser,</hi> and <hi>Holier,</hi> and <hi>Better,</hi> and fitter for thy Blessed <hi>Acceptance</hi> in Jesus Christ my only Saviour.</p>

               <p>There is no Hiding any thing from thee, the <hi>Infinite</hi> God, who fillest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth. What shall I say unto thee, Lord!
